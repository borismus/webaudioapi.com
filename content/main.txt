This site started as a place to host Web Audio [samples][] for an
upcoming Web Audio API [book][]. However, the front page seems like a
fine place to include more information about the Web Audio API.

Other web audio resources:

- [Web Audio API W3C specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html)
- [Web Audio Examples](http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/index.html)
- [Getting started with the Web Audio API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/)
- [Developing game audio with the Web Audio API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/games/)
- [Scheduling Web Audio with precision](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/audio/scheduling/)
- [Web MIDI API W3C specification](http://webaudio.github.com/web-midi-api/)
- [Web Audio playground](http://webaudioplayground.appspot.com/)
- [Web Audio browser support test](http://www.doboism.com/projects/webaudio-compatibility/)

If you'd like to change something about this site (eg. add a link to
your blog post, add a new sample to the list, want to tweak the design),
or have some other idea, submit a pull request to the [github repo][gh],
or drop me a line.
